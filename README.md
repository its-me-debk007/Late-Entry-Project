## <h2 align=center>Purpose & Functionality of App 📱</h2>

### Purpose
This app is created for an official purpose **currently being used in our College**, in order to easily keep a track on students coming late to the college. 
The app data is synced with a remote server, where data is stored permanently.

### Functionality
- The user must **authenticate** himself first in order to start scanning
- The app provides a quick barcode scanner, with an option to enable flash
- In case of damaged camera/barcode, the user can **manually** enter student number and register a late entry
- On scanning or manually entering data, student details pops up with **name**, **branch**, **admission year**, **image**, & **student no** (which are stored in app's database to provide quicker access)
- In offline scenario, all entries are stored in **app's database**, & can be synced with the server afterwards
- The Settings page include the option to sync locally stored student details & late entry records and other options related to the user
